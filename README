This is a modification of the smbnetfs to allow diferent users accces a share with diferent credentials.

The point is that I needed to acces shares specifying the user in the path but not the password (like this: cd mountpoint/user@192.168.3.12/share) retrieving the password from the auth file. 
I found that its possible to specifiy the user and password in the path (like this: cd mountpoint/user\:password@192.168.3.12/share) or in the auth file, but not possible to specify the user in the path and let the program find the corresponding password in the auth file.

This modification has been send to Mikhail Kshevetskiy the current mantainer of smbnetfs but never seems to find time to review it.

This patch works fine with smbnetfs v0.5.3a.
If you use a Debian based linux distribution you can easily get and then patch the original sources with apt-get:

1. Get the sources:
apt-get source smbnetfs

2. Resolve dependencies:
apt-get build-dep smbnetfs

3. Apply the patch:
patch -p1 smbnetfs.patch

4. Compile and build a new deb package:
apt-get -b source smbnetfs
